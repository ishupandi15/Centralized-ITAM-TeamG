## Project Overview
This project designs and proposes a Centralized IT Asset Management (ITAM) System for IniTech Solutions.  
It replaces decentralized Excel-based tracking with a robust, automated platform that improves data accuracy, enables real-time asset visibility, and reduces operational costs.

The project includes:
- Lab 1 – Terms & Concepts  
- Lab 2 – Project Plan  
- Milestone 1 – Project Charter  
- Milestone 2 – Systems Analysis & Requirements  
- Milestone 3 – Systems Design  
- Milestone 4 – Final Presentation  

---

## Objectives
- Improve IT asset tracking efficiency and transparency  
- Reduce manual data entry errors and duplication  
- Enable real-time reporting and asset status visibility  
- Ensure secure, role-based system access  
- Support data-driven decision-making  

---

## Features and Functionalities
- Serialized Asset Tracking – each asset assigned a unique serial ID  
- Stockroom Management – real-time inventory, asset assignment, and overdue returns  
- Asset Request Workflow – request, approval, fulfillment, and return processes  
- Security Authentication – role-based access control with login validation  
- Reporting Dashboard – visual insights for administrators and executives  

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Cloud Hosting: AWS / Azure / GCP  
- Frontend: React.js / Angular  
- Backend: Node.js (Express) / Django (REST)  
- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL  
- Visualization: Tableau / Power BI  
- Documentation: Microsoft Word / PowerPoint  
- Project Management: Microsoft Project

## System Architecture and Design Highlights
Network Topology: endpoints → secure application servers → database servers → backup layer  
Entity-Relationship Diagram: includes entities such as Users, Assets, Stockrooms, Requests, and Audit Logs  
Security Model: authentication, authorization, and logging for all user actions  
UI Mockups: demonstrate user workflows from login to fulfillment  
Diagrams: provided in Milestone 3 Systems Design document and visuals folder
